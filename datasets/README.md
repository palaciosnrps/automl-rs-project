Most of the datasets used for this project are already available in the Tensorflow-datasets collection, however, three
more datasets were used (BrazilDam, Coffee scenes, Cerrado-Savanna scenes).

The code for building them as part of the tensorflow-dataset package can be found in the folder 'tf-new-datasets’, 
the script ‘load tfds.sh’ needs to be executed.

The existing datasets were build using Tensorflow datasets version 1.2 and to add the new ones tfds-nightly 4.2.0dev was used.
